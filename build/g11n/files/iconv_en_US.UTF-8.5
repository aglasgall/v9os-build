.SH NOTES
If a source character code value cannot be mapped to a valid character in
target codeset, it will be considered as an \fBillegal\fR or
a \fBnon-identical\fR character. In the absence of explicit information
about the source character code value, iconv code conversions use
the following rules in determining whether a character is an illegal or
a non-identical:
.LP
If the source character code value is not within a range defined by the source
codeset standard, it is considered as an illegal character. If the source
character code value is within the range(s) defined by the standard, it will be
considered as a non-identical, even if the source character code value maps
to an undefined or a reserved location within the valid range.
The non-identical character will map to either '?' (0x3f)
if the target codeset is a non-Unicode codeset or to Unicode replacement
character (U+FFFD) if the target codeset is an Unicode codeset, i.e.,
UCS-2, UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE,
UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UCS-4, UCS-4BE, UCS-4LE,
UTF-7, UTF-8 and so on.
.LP
UCS-2BE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE, and UCS-4BE are UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-32, and UCS-4
in Big Endian byte ordering, respectively, and do not contain Byte Order Mark,
also known as BOM and U+FEFF, in the beginning of a file or character
stream.  If the first character of the file or character stream is the BOM
character, the character will be treated as a Zero Width No-Break Space
(ZWNBSP) character.  UCS-2LE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE, and UCS-4LE are UCS-2,
UTF-16, UTF-32, and UCS-4 in Little Endian byte ordering, respectively,
and do not contain BOM character in the beginning of a file or character
stream. If the first character of the file or character stream is the BOM
character, the character will be treated as a ZWNBSP character.
UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-32, and UCS-4 files and character streams usually start
with a BOM character to indicate the byte ordering used in the file or
character stream. In the same sense, therefore, when the target codeset is
UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-32, or UCS-4, expect a BOM character in the beginning of
the iconv code conversion output buffer.
When the source codeset is UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-32, and UCS-4 and there is no
BOM presented as the first input character, the byte ordering of the current
system is assumed on the input byte stream given to the iconv code conversion.
.LP
IBM PC and EBCDIC code pages are prefixed with "IBM-" as like IBM-037 in
the codeset name. Microsoft code pages are prefixed with "CP" as like CP850
in the codeset name.
.LP
iso-8859-1, ISO-8859-1, iso8859-1, and ISO8859-1, are aliases of 8859-1.
In the same way, each of 8859-1, 8859-2, 8859-3, 8859-4, 8859-5, 8859-6,
8859-7, 8859-8, 8859-9, 8859-10, 8859-13, 8859-14, 8859-15, and 8859-16 has
similar aliases. ucs-2 is an alias of UCS-2. In the same manner, each of
UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE,
UCS-4, UCS-4BE, and UCS-4LE has a lowercase alias.  US-ASCII (and also
us-ascii), koi8-r, koi8-u, and utf-ebcdic are aliases of 646, KOI8-R, KOI8-U,
and UTF-EBCDIC, respectively. The aliases are provided for user convenience.
.LP
UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion simply moves bytes from input buffer to
output buffer without doing any conversion. During the moves, illegal character
checking is done to screen out any potentially harmful character bytes.
Such illegal characters will cause the conversion to fail.
.LP
ACE stands for ASCII Compatible Encoding defined in the RFC 3490 without
allowing unassigned characters; it also uses STD3 ASCII rules.
ACE-ALLOW-UNASSIGNED is the same to the ACE except that it will allow
unassigned characters. The ACE-ALLOW-UNASSIGNED is more suitable for
query purpose; the ACE is more suitable for storing or giving host or
domain names to machines.
