NOTE:

This tree does not contain bits of the Studio compiler suites.  This is a simple
a list of all the files and their permissions in order for packaging the suites
that have been otherwise legally obtained.

It would appear that SunStudio12.1 is redistributable for the sole purpose of
building OpenSolaris-based distros (of which Illumos is).  So, it *should* be
safe to publish this package as a part of an Illumos build environment.

The SolStudio12.2 packages are not redistributable, you must get them from
Sun Microsystems.  You *SHOULD NOT* publish the package anywhere accessible by
others.  We provide the packaging manifest merely for convenience to take
a studio12.2 install you obtained from Sun Microsystems and convert it
into a pkg5 image for a unified install experience.
